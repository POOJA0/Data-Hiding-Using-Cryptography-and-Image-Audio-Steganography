# Data-Hiding-Using-Cryptography-and-Image-Audio-Steganography
In this project, data hiding techniques are combined into a single system to enhance the secrecy of the data, by first encrypting the data to be hidden using the RSA algorithm and then embedding this encrypted data inside an image or an audio file using the concept of LSB algorithm.
